## Data

The training and testing data is available in the `data` folder. There are sampled from X-CSQA, MEDQA-ZH, and MEDQA-EN datasets. The data is in the format of `json` files. We provide the self-consistent DPO and SFT data.

## Models

We use the Llama and Mistral [LlamaFactory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) framework for training and inference.
