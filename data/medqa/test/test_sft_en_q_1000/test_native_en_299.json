Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead.

Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study?\n(A) Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.\n(B) The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.\n(C) The inclusion of attack rates would increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.\n(D) The inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.\n",
